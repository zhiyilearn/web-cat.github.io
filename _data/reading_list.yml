    This paper addresses the issue of how to approach the teaching of software testing. This paper presents a software testing 
    framework identifying five essential principles that motivate the types of testing experiences a student should gain from the curriculum. 
    The framework is illustrated using a simple test problem.

  summary: >
    An experiment was performed to test a method of helping  students resist these responses to stereotype threat. Specifically, students in the experimental condition of the experiment 
    were encouraged to see intelligence—the object of the stereotype—as a malleable rather than fixed capacity. 
    This mind-set was predicted to make students' performances less vulnerable to stereotype threat and help them maintain their psychological
    engagement with academics, both of which could help boost their college grades. Results were consistent with predictions. 
    The African American students (and, to some degree, the White students) encouraged to view intelligence as malleable reported 
    greater enjoyment of the academic process, greater academic engagement, and obtained higher grade point averages than their counterparts 
    in two control groups.

  summary: >
    Two studies explored the role of implicit theories of intelligence in adolescents' mathematics achievement. 
    In Study 1 with 373 7th graders, the belief that intelligence is malleable (incremental theory) predicted 
    an upward trajectory in grades over the two years of junior high school, while a belief that intelligence 
    is fixed (entity theory) predicted a flat trajectory. A mediational model including learning goals, positive beliefs about effort, 
    and causal attributions and strategies was tested. In Study 2, an intervention teaching an incremental theory to 7th graders (N=48) 
    promoted positive change in classroom motivation, compared with a control group (N=43). Simultaneously, 
    students in the control group displayed a continuing downward trajectory in grades, 
    while this decline was reversed for students in the experimental group.

    Our study was based on exploring CS1 students' implicit theories of intelligence. Referencing Dweck and Leggett's  framework 
    for implicit theories of intelligence, we investigated (1) how students' implicit theories changed over the course of a semester, 
    (2) how these changes differed as a function of course enrollment and students' self-regulation profiles, 
    and (3) whether or not implicit theories predicted standardized course grades and performance on a computational thinking knowledge test.

  summary: >
    The  study  of  achievement  goals  has  illuminated  basic  motivational  processes,  though  controversy
    surrounds  their  nature  and  impact.  In  5  studies,  including  a  longitudinal  study  in  a  difficult  premed
    course, the authors show that the impact of learning and performance goals depends on how they are operationalized. Active
    learning goals predicted active coping, sustained motivation, and higher achievement in the face of challenge. Among performance goals,
    ability-linked goals predicted withdrawal and poorer performance in the face of challenge (but provided a “boost” to performance 
    when students met with success); normative goals did not predict decrements in motivation or performance; and
    outcome goals (wanting a good grade) were in fact equally related to learning goals and ability goals. Ways in
    which the findings address discrepancies in the literature are discussed.

    They argue that educational games can be improved by fundamentally changing their incentive structures to promote the growth mindset, 
    or the belief that intelligence is malleable. We present "brain points," a system that encourages the development of growth mindset 
    behaviors by directly incentivizing effort, use of strategy, and incremental progress. Through a study of 15,000 children, 
    they show that the "brain points" system encourages more low-performing students to persist in the educational game Refraction 
    when compared to a control, and increases overall time played, strategy use, and perseverance after challenge. 
    They believe that this growth mindset incentive structure has great potential in many educational environments.

  summary: >
    In this study they attempted a "saying is believing" intervention to encourage CS1 students to adopt a growth mindset both in general 
    and towards programming. Despite notable success of this type of intervention in a non-CS context, 
    Their results offered few statistically significant differences both from pre-survey to post-survey and between control and intervention 
    groups. Further, the statistically significant results we did find differed in direction between institutions 
    (some students exhibited more growth response, others less). We analyzed further evidence to explore possible confounding issues 
    including whether our intervention even registered with students and how students interpreted the questions which they used to assess 
    their self-theories.

    They suggest an term, the "geekiness quotient (GQ)". The GQ, grounded in Gardner's work on multiple intelligences, 
    is a hypothetical measure of the student's current CS ability. The GQ supports a moderate view of the geek gene: 
    that students arrive in our classrooms with a range of CS abilities, whether acquired through background or innate talent, 
    and can improve their abilities through effort.
